# Configuring TMIV

## Basic structure of the TMIV configuration files

The TMIV configuration files use the [JSON](http://json.org) file format. The main parameters are key-value pairs of the root object, for example:

```json
{
  "intraPeriod": 32,
  "blockSize": 16
}
```

Selectable components follow this pattern:

```json
{
  "PrunerMethod": "HierarchicalPruner",
  "HierarchicalPruner": {
    "erode": 3,
    "etcetera": "..."
  }
}
```

In some cases there is a bypass component, e.g. `NoPruner` or `NoCuller`. Even though these have no parameters, the key still needs to be provided:

```json
{
  "PrunerMethod": "NoPruner",
  "NoPruner": { }
}
```

## Input/output parameters

TMIV constructs input and output paths using:
1. base directories `configDirectory`, `inputDirectory` and `outputDirectory`,
1. path formats with [{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) syntax.

The [format syntax](https://fmt.dev/latest/syntax.html#syntax) is convenient and flexible. It is not required to use all available placeholders and with positional placeholders it is possible to use the same placeholder multiple times.

### Base directories

* **configDirectory**: the base directory for the configuration files.
* **inputDirectory**: the base directory for the input files.
* **outputDirectory**: the base directory for the output files.

An experiment may have multiple steps, e.g. Encoder, Multiplexer, Decoder, in which case the output directory of one step may correspond to the input directory of the next step.

Base directories can be overriden by using absolute paths for the path formats:
* `/my/output/dir` plus `my_filename.yuv` gives `/my/output/dir/my_filename.yuv`
* `/my/output/dir` plus `/my/path.yuv` gives `/my/path.yuv`

### Path format placeholders

Depending on the situation, the following placeholders are available to form paths:

* **Atlas ID** (e.g. 12) as read from the bitstream
* **Atlas index** in `0 .. atlas count - 1`, as determined by the test model
* **Content ID** (e.g. J for Kitchen), as specified by the `-s` command-line parameter
* **Frame height** (e.g. 1080) as determined by the test model
* **Frame index** is 0 for the Encoder and in the range `0 .. number of input frames - 1` for the Renderer
* **Frame width** (e.g. 1920) as determined by the test model
* **Number of input frames** (e.g. 97), as specified by the `-n` command-line parameter
* **Number of output frames** (e.g. 300), as specified by the `-N` command-line parameter
* **Pose trace name** (e.g. p02) as specified using the `-P` command-line parameter
* **Test ID** (e.g. R0 or QP3) as specified by the `-r` command-line parameter
* **Video format** (e.g. yuv420p10le) as determined by the test model
* **View index** in `0 .. view count - 1`, as determined by the test model
* **View name** (e.g. v11) as specified using the `-v` command-line parameter or determined by the test model

## Profile-tier-level parameters

The Encoder accepts profile-tier-level parameters and writes these into the bitstream. The Encoder does not check these parameters.
In general the Encoder is happy to go out-of-profile to enable experiments. Similarly, the Decoder will check PTL constraints but will only warn.
The DecoderLog executable checks conformance of a bitstream, and will raise a runtime error when a bitstream is out-of-profile. 

* **toolsetIdc:** string; the `ptl_profile_toolset_idc` value, as in the specification, e.g. "MIV Main".
* **levelIdc:** string; the `ptl_level_idc` value, as a string "1.0", "1.5", etc. On the command-line, add quotes otherwise the value is interpret as a number.
* **oneV3cFrameOnly:** bool; the `ptc_one_v3c_frame_only_flag` value.
* **reconstructionIdc:** string; the `ptl_reconstruction_idc` value, as in the specification, e.g. "Rec Unconstrained".

Note that:

* The `ptc_max_decodes` value is automatically determined by the Encoder.
* The `ptc_restricted_geometry_flag` is false for the Encoder and true for the MpiEncoder.

## Algorithmic parameters

Some of the algorithmic components of the test model have parameters. This section provides a short description of these parameters in reference to the _test model_ [[4]](/README.md#references).

Some general parameters are defined in the root of the configuration file. All others are defined in the node of a component.

### General parameters

These parameters are in the root of the configuration file and may be accessed by multiple components:

  By default, the encoder will select a start frame based on the sequence configuration.

    * **haveTextureVideo:** bool; output attribute video data (AVD) to encode the texture attribute. When false texture data is still needed as input of the test model.
    * **haveTransparencyVideo:** bool; output attribute video data (AVD) to encode the transparency attribute.

* Atlas frame size calculation and packing:
    * **intraPeriod:** int; the intra period as in video codecs, indicating the period between independent random access points (IRAP). This value dictates the intra period of the atlas bitstreams and common atlas bitstream. The video sub bitstreams need to have the same value.
    * **interPeriod:** int; the period between inter-coded common atlas frames and atlas frames, counting both IRAP and non-IRAP frames. When omitted, the inter period will equal the intra period, such that all frames are IRAP frames.

        * 2: _N_ groups, with the group-based encoder, partitions views to independently encode multiple groups of atlases.
    * **occupancyScale:** int[2]; the downscale factor of occupancy maps applied across all atlases when occupancy is signaled explicitly.

  * **halveDepthRange:** bool; use half of the available geometry resolution when depth quality is low
  * **depthOccThresholdIfSet:** float; the value of the depth-occupancy map threshold times 2<sup>-geoBitDepth</sup>, in case occupancy information is encoded in the geometry video data of a specific view.
  * **depthOccThresholdAsymmetry:** float; decoder threshold asymmetry `a` in (0, 2). The encoder places the first depth value at level `2T`. The decoder threshold is `aT`. a = 1 is symmetric.
